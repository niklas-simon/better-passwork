# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: 24.10.2025**

This Privacy Policy explains how Better Passwork manages data on your device.

## Data Collection and Non-Collection

We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal user data.

The extension does not track browsing activity, collect usage statistics, or send any personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive information off your device to any external servers, including ours.

## Core Functionality and Local Data Use

The sole purpose of this extension is to read and display credentials from a Passwork password manager instance.

- **Access**: The extension accesses data (passwords and related details) directly from the Passwork API only when explicitly invoked by the user.
- **Handling**: This Passwork data is processed entirely on the user's local device for immediate display within the extension's user interface. The data is not retained or stored after the session or display is closed.
